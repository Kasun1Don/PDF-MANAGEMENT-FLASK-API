# API for dynamically generating PDFs - QuickDoc API


## The Problem and Solution

Documents are central to professional communication, wether it be invoices, contracts,reports and brochures. Businesses generate billions of PDFs daily. Traditional methods for generating PDFs based on real-time business data often required complex processes varying from manual data entry to custom scripting involving multiple handoffs between  different software systems. A PDF generation API addresses these challenges by providing a more automated and efficient way to create documents with real-time data. What takes hours can be done in seconds. 

Example use cases:
* Automating contract generation with pre-defined legal clauses and personalized data.
* Generating invoices with real-time product details and pricing. 

An AIIM (Association for Intelligent Information Management) study on the benefits of document processing automation shows organizations can reduce document processing times by an average of 80% with automation. Much of this is attributed to a 30 - 50% reduction in the time that staff spend on document related tasks. 

Businesses can tailor documents to their specific needs using custom templates, which combine pre-defined layouts with dynamic data fields. The API seamlessly merges data with the template, generating a complete and customized PDF document.

Furthermore, the API enables document signatures and tracking.
